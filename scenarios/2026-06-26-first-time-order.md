# Bunche — Scenario Replay: First-Time Customer Orders ISP UK

**Date captured:** 2026-06-26
**Status:** Rules extracted + locked into WORKFLOW_SPECS for v3
**Last update:** Removed data collection summary from first message (cleaner UX)

---

## Purpose

This document captures the **exact turn-by-turn UX we agreed on** for a brand-new customer ordering their first proxy. It serves as the canonical reference for:
- Building the n8n workflow
- QA testing the customer experience
- Training future agents or operators

---

## The Scenario (Verbatim)

### Customer persona: Dan, first-time user, no name saved, no referral

---

### Turn 1 — Customer: `Hi`

**System (Bunche internal):**
- New phone → NEW CUSTOMER branch
- LLM Intent Parser: greeting
- 24h LLM cache miss → cache stored

**Customer-facing:**

```

**Rules extracted:**
- ✅ First message = greeting + full services + prices + tip
- ✅ No `free trial` mention at this stage (added later when customer asks or admin nudges)
- ✅ Tips are embedded inline with each product line where useful
- ✅ No name ask here
- ✅ **Legal notice: Terms + Privacy + AUP with explicit "BY REPLYING YOU AGREE TO"** (NDPR compliance)
- ❌ ~~Data collection summary~~ — REMOVED this session (cleaner UX, legal docs are enough)

---

### Turn 2 — Customer: `I want uk ISP`

(Same as before)

---

### Turn 3 — Customer: `Yes`

(Same as before)

---

### Turn 4 — (Off-screen) Customer pays via Flutterwave

(Same as before)

---

### Turn 5 — Bunche (Workflow 2 → Name capture, BEFORE delivering IP)

**Customer-facing:**

```
✅ Payment received — ₦6,500

⚡ Generating your UK IP now...

🔐 Before I send your proxy — what should we call you?

This becomes your referral name — share it with friends and you earn
5% credit on their first order. Credit never expires.

Reply with a name (letters + numbers, 3–20 chars) 👇

Example: Chidi · Tunde22 · Maya_proxy
```

---

### Turn 6 — Customer: `Dan`

**System:**
- Name uniqueness check: `dan` not taken ✅
- Save name = 'Dan'
- Trigger PIN offer (Workflow 2 sub-step)

**Customer-facing:**

```
Welcome Dan 🎉 — your referral name is now Dan.

🔐 One quick thing before I send your proxy:

Set a 4-digit PIN so you can access your IP details from any phone number.
(Skip if you don't want this.)

Reply with a 4-digit number 👇
Or reply skip to continue without a PIN.

💡 Why a PIN? If you lose your phone or buy a new SIM, the PIN lets
you prove it's you and recover your proxies from any number.
```

---

### Turn 7 — Customer: `1234`

(Same as before — delivers IP)

---

## New Rule Locked This Session (Update #3)

### Legal Notice on First Message (Final Form)

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| **What** | Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy appear in first message |
| **Format** | Section labeled "⚖️ BY REPLYING YOU AGREE TO:" with bullet list + URLs |
| **Consent mechanism** | Implicit — customer replies = agrees (NDPR-compliant for WhatsApp context) |
| **Data collection summary** | ❌ NOT included (removed — cleaner UX, legal docs cover it) |
| **URLs** | Use deployed domain (bunche.ng) — short, clean, mobile-friendly |
| **Where stored** | `legal/` directory in repo, deployed to domain |

**Why this final form:** The legal notice is sufficient for consent. Adding a "we collect / don't collect" summary in every first message is clutter — customers don't read it, and the Privacy Policy already covers it in detail. Cleaner UX = better customer experience.
