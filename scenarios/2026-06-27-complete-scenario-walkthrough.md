**Date:** 2026-06-27
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE — all 5 canonical scenarios + admin operations
**Source:** 5 scenario docs + 18 admin commands + WORKFLOW_SPECS

---

## How to Read This Document

Each scenario shows:
1. **Customer message** — what the person on WhatsApp types
2. **Bunche system** — what happens behind the scenes
3. **Bunche reply** — what the customer sees on WhatsApp
4. **Admin side** — what admin sees, gets notified about, or acts on

---

## SCENARIO 1: First-Time Paid Order (ISP UK)

### Flow: Customer → Bunche → Admin

---

#### STEP 1 — Customer sends `Hi`

```
Customer: Hi
```

**Bunche system:**
- Receive WhatsApp webhook
- Signature verify ✅
- Idempotency check ✅ (new sender)
- Rate limit ✅
- Hash phone → check customers table → **NEW PHONE**
- LLM Intent Parser: { intent: greeting, confidence: 0.99 }
- 24h LLM cache miss → cache response

**Bunche reply:** Standard first-time greeting (services + prices + legal notice + tip)

**Admin side:** None

---

#### STEP 2 — Customer sends `I want UK ISP`

```
Customer: I want UK ISP
```

**Bunche system:**
- LLM Intent Parser: { intent: order, product: ISP, country: UK, quantity: 1 }
- NEW CUSTOMER branch
- **PRE-PAYMENT CHECK (ALL PROVIDERS):**
  - POST Proxy-Seller /balance → 200 OK, balance $45.20 ✅
  - GET Proxy-Seller /countries → UK available ✅
  - POST DataImpulse /balance → 200 OK ✅
  - GET DataImpulse /products → UK available via ISP (Proxy-Seller) ✅
- All checks pass → generate order
- Generate order ID: ORD-20260627-0947
- Generate Flutterwave payment link (expires: NOW + 30 min)
- Log: order_pending, provider_check_pass

**Bunche reply:**

```
✅ Confirmed: 1 × ISP UK @ ₦6,500/mo

💳 Pay here:
👉 https://checkout.flutterwave.com/ORD-20260627-0947

Pay with:
• Bank transfer • Card • USSD • QR code

⏰ Link valid for 30 minutes.

💡 Tip: Bank transfer is fastest — most banks complete in under 30 seconds.

Once I see your payment, your IP arrives in under 2 minutes ⚡
```

**Admin side:** None (pre-check passed silently)

---

#### STEP 3 — (Off-screen) Customer pays via Flutterwave

**Bunche system (webhook):**
- Flutterwave POSTs to `/webhook/payment`
- HMAC verify (verif-hash) ✅
- Idempotency: Redis key → miss → PostgreSQL check ✅ → payment successful ✅
- **Workflow 2 triggered**

---

#### STEP 4 — Customer sends `Paid`

```
Customer: Paid
```

**Bunche system:**
- LLM Intent Parser: { intent: payment_confirmation }
- Check order ORD-20260627-0947: status=paid ✅
- **Generate IP via Proxy-Seller API:** ip=198.51.100.42, port=8000, user=bunche_uk_a3c8, pass=T7nQ9xM2pK, expires=2026-07-27
- **TEST IP (2 endpoints, 5s timeout):** curl → ✅ PASS
- Update order: status=fulfilled
- **Trigger name capture (Workflow 2 sub-step)**

**Bunche reply:**

```
✅ Payment received — ₦6,500

⚡ Generating your UK IP now...

🔐 Before I send your proxy — what should we call you?

This becomes your referral name — share it with friends and you earn
5% credit on their first order. Credit never expires.

Reply with a name (letters + numbers, 3–20 chars) 👇

Example: Chidi · Tunde22 · Maya_proxy
```

**Admin side:** None

---

#### STEP 5 — Customer sends `Dan`

```
Customer: Dan
```

**Bunche system:**
- Name uniqueness: `SELECT id FROM customers WHERE LOWER(name)='dan'` → NOT taken ✅
- Save: INSERT customers + link order → customer
- Trigger **PIN offer sub-step**

**Bunche reply:**

```
Welcome Dan 🎉 — your referral name is now Dan.

🔐 One quick thing before I send your proxy:

Set a 4-digit PIN so you can access your IP details from any phone number.
(Skip if you don't want this.)

Reply with a 4-digit number 👇
Or reply skip to continue without a PIN.

💡 Why a PIN? If you lose your phone or buy a new SIM, the PIN lets
you prove it's you and recover your proxies from any number.
```

**Admin side:** None

---

#### STEP 6 — Customer sends `1234` (or `skip`)

```
Customer: 1234
```

**Bunche system:**
- bcrypt hash PIN → store in customers.pin_hash
- Deliver the proxy

**Bunche reply:**

```
No problem — your proxy is ready.

```
⚠️ ISP US is temporarily unavailable.

Our provider is currently down — we can't generate ISP proxies right now.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ OTHER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW:

```

**Admin side:** 🟢 Provider RESTORED → customers notified

---

## SCENARIO 3: New Number / Account Recovery

### Flow: Customer → Bunche → Admin

---

#### STEP 1 — `Hi` → standard greeting (don't leak account)

---

#### STEP 2 — Customer reveals lost phone

```
Customer: Please I misplaced my phone and I'm messaging with a new number.
Can I get my IP details?
```

**Bunche system:** Need BOTH name + PIN to authenticate

**Bunche reply:**
```
🔐 Sorry to hear that — let's get you back in.

To verify it's really you, I need TWO things:

1️⃣ Your referral name (e.g. Dan, Chidi, Tunde22)
2️⃣ Your 4-digit PIN

⚠️ Wrong PIN 3 times = locked + admin alert.

Reply with both, like: Dan 1234
```

---

#### STEP 3 — Customer sends `Dan 1234`

**Bunche system:**
- Name lookup: `SELECT ... WHERE LOWER(name)='dan'` → found ✅
- bcrypt PIN verify: MATCH ✅
- Look up active proxies
- **Ask before changing primary phone**

**Bunche reply:**
```
✅ Verified — welcome back, Dan!

I found 1 active proxy on your account. Showing now ↓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 YOUR ACTIVE PROXIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🇺🇸 ISP US (expires July 27, 2026)
🔗 IP: 198.51.100.42
🔌 Port: 8000

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ SECURITY: Should I link this new number to your account?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Reply:
• link — this new number becomes your primary. Old number loses access.
• keep both — both numbers work, but only the new one for new orders.
```

---

#### STEP 4A — Customer sends `link`

**Bunche system:**
- Update primary phone to new number
- **Send security alert to OLD phone**

**Bunche reply (new phone):**
```
✅ Done — this number is now your primary.

📞 Old number: +234...OLD (no longer has access)
📞 New number: +234...NEW (this one, primary)

🔒 Security alert sent to your old number.
```

**Bunche reply (OLD phone simultaneously):**
```
📱 Your Bunche account is now linked to a new number.
If this wasn't you, reply STOP immediately.
```

**Admin side:** ⚠️ Logged: phone_linked, old_phone, new_phone

---

#### STEP 4B — Customer sends `STOP` from old phone

**Bunche system:**
- Reverse the link
- Lock account until PIN reset

**Admin side:** 🔴 Alert:
```
🚨 STOP RECEIVED FROM OLD PHONE

Customer: Dan
Action: Link reversed. Account locked.
Old phone +234...OLD: no longer linked.
New phone +234...NEW: pending verification.
```

---

## SCENARIO 4: Forgot PIN

### Flow: Customer → Bunche → Admin

---

#### STEP 1-2 — `Hi` → "lost phone" → Bunche asks for name + PIN

---

#### STEP 3 — Customer sends `I forgot my PIN`

**Bunche system:** Trigger order-details verification

**Bunche reply:**
```
No problem — let's verify your identity another way.

What was your last order? (You don't need the exact details,
just enough to confirm it's you.)

Tell me:
• What product did you buy? (e.g. ISP UK, Residential 5GB)
• Roughly when? (e.g. last week, this month)
• What country was it for? (if applicable)

I'll cross-check against your account.
```

---

#### STEP 4 — Customer describes correctly

```
Customer: I bought ISP UK, about 2 weeks ago, for the UK
```

**Bunche system:** Order found → allow access

**Bunche reply:**
```
✅ Identity confirmed — welcome back, Dan!

Since you forgot your PIN, let's set a new one.

🔐 Reply with a new 4-digit number 👇
(Skip if you don't want a PIN.)
```

---

#### STEP 4X — Customer describes INCORRECTLY × 3

**Bunche system:** 3 failures → 15-min lockout

**Bunche reply:**
```
🔒 Your account is temporarily locked.

This happens after 3 failed identity checks — for your security.

Try again in 15 minutes, or contact admin for help.
```

**Admin side:** 🔴 Alert:
```
🚨 FORGOT-PIN LOCKOUT

Customer: Dan (a3f2b9...)
Result: 3 failed verification attempts
Lockout: 15 minutes

Risk: Possible account takeover attempt.
```

**CRITICAL ANTI-LEAK:** Bunche NEVER reveals actual order details (IP, exact date, amount) on failed verification — attacker learns nothing usable.

---

## SCENARIO 5: Free Trial

### Flow: Customer → Bunche → Admin

---

#### STEP 1 — `Hi` → standard greeting

---

#### STEP 2 — Customer asks for free trial

```
Customer: Do you have a free plan, your product seems expensive for me right now
```

## CRITICAL SECURITY RULES (Summary)

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Never reveal account existence from name alone | Must have PIN to confirm |
| Never show order details on failed verification | Anti-leak: attacker learns nothing |
| Wrong PIN × 3 = 15-min lockout + admin alert | Brute-force protection |
| All admin actions logged with phone_hash | Full audit trail |
| High-risk commands need PIN + TOTP | Two-factor for financial actions |
| Phone link sends alert to OLD number | Theft/fraud protection |
| Old phone STOP = reverse link + lock | Reversibility |
| Daily limit on free trials = 3 per phone | Anti-abuse |
| Theorem Reach HMAC verified before grant | Anti-fake-survey |
| All IP tested before delivery | Quality gate |
| Pre-payment check = ALL providers | Never generate link without confirming stock |
