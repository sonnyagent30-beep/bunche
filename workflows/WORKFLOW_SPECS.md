# Bunche — n8n Workflow Specifications
*Zero-inventory, fully on-demand. Ollama + LiteLLM for natural language. No account creation — ever. Admin involved ONLY when human judgment is needed.*

## Refund Policy

**⚠️ STRICT: No refunds after proxy is generated and delivered.**

> Once a proxy IP is generated and sent to the customer, the sale is FINAL.
> Refunds are only considered in specific exempt cases listed below.

### Exemptions — Refunds ARE Allowed

| Case | Description | Who Approves |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Provider API failure** | Proxy never worked from the start | Admin — automatic |
| **Wrong IP delivered** | Wrong country/spec sent | Admin |
| **Fraudulent order** | Order placed with stolen payment | Admin |
| **Duplicate charge** | Same order charged twice | Admin — automatic |
| **Admin-approved exemption** | Exceptional circumstance | Admin only |

### Non-Exemptions — NO Refund

| Case | Reason |
|------|--------|
| "I changed my mind" | Proxy already generated and usable |
| "Platform banned my IP" | Outside our control — see replacement policy |
| "I don't need it anymore" | Service was delivered |
| "Found cheaper elsewhere" | Not our concern |
| Customer claims it doesn't work | Must prove it never worked from the start |
| Account banned by platform | Platform decision — not a proxy defect |

---

## Pre-Payment Health Check — Overview

**We NEVER let a customer pay unless we know we can deliver.**

```
Customer selects product → We check provider availability FIRST
→ If provider is UP + IPs available → Generate payment link
→ If provider is DOWN or no IPs → Tell customer, don't charge them
```

**Why this matters:**
- Customer pays only when we can deliver ✅
- No refunds needed because no failed deliveries ✅
- Customer trust preserved ✅

---

## IP Testing — Overview

**We test every IP before sending it to a customer.**

```
Provider returns IP → We test it (5 second timeout)
→ If IP responds → Send to customer ✅
→ If IP fails → Request replacement → Test replacement
→ If replacement fails → Refund customer automatically ✅
```

**Why this matters:**
- Customer only receives working IPs ✅
- We catch dead IPs before they do ✅
- No "this proxy doesn't work" complaints ✅

No expiry reminder (data never expires!)
```

### Mobile — Dual (Data + Time)

```
Daily cron:
→ Data Remaining ≤ 1GB → Send warning
→ Data Remaining == 0GB → Send exhausted notice
→ Expires At ≤ 3 days AND Data Remaining > 0GB → Send expiry reminder
```

## Random IP Tips Pool

**Rotate randomly — pick 1 per message. No repeat until all used.**

```
💡 DID YOU KNOW?

🌐 ISP proxies use real home/office IP addresses.

📱 Mobile proxies use real 4G/5G networks.

🏢 Datacenter IPs come from servers — fast and cheap.

🔄 Residential proxies bounce through real home devices.

🕐 ISP proxies stay stable longer than mobile.

🌍 US and UK IPs are among the most trusted.

📺 Some platforms check IPs against GPS data.

💰 High-trust IPs cost more because they're less likely flagged.

🔒 Using a proxy hides your real IP.

📡 Proxy speed depends on location.

⚡ Datacenter proxies are fastest — great for automation.

🌐 ISP = Internet Service Provider.

🔁 Mobile proxies rotate IPs as you use them.

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁿󠁧󠁢󠁿 Proxy IPs hide your location.

🎯 One IP per platform = cleaner account history.

## System Architecture

```
Customer WhatsApp Message
        ↓
[SECURITY LAYER] — Strip links, files, jailbreak attempts
        ↓
[CHECK: New customer?] → YES → Legal notice → Workflow 1b
                       → NO  → Workflow 1a
        ↓
[LLM PARSING] — Ollama via LiteLLM → structured intent
        ↓
[PRE-PAYMENT HEALTH CHECK] ← NEW!
  → Call provider API → Check availability
  → If DOWN → Tell customer, NO payment link
  → If UP → Continue
        ↓
[IF ROUTINE ORDER] → Flutterwave payment link
  ↓
[POST-PAYMENT] → Provider generates proxy
        ↓

## The Core Principle

| What happens | Who does it |
|-------------|------------|
| Pre-payment health check | n8n checks provider before payment link ✅ |
| Provider down → No payment link | n8n tells customer, no charge ✅ |
| IP testing before delivery | n8n tests every IP (5s timeout) ✅ |
| IP fails → replacement | n8n requests new IP ✅ |
| Replacement also fails → refund | n8n refunds automatically ✅ |
| ISP/DC → time-based tracking | n8n ✅ |
| Residential → data never expires | n8n ✅ |
| Mobile → 30-day, no rollover | n8n ✅ |
| Refund request (not our fault) | n8n auto-approves ✅ |
| Refund request (our fault) | n8n declines → admin ⚠️ |
| Ban claim with screenshot | Admin review ⚠️ |
| Admin commands | Admin handles ⚠️ |

---

## Admin WhatsApp Interface

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `Admin` | Show all pending actions |
| `Approve ORD-XXXXX` | Approve replacement/refund |
| `Reject ORD-XXXXX [reason]` | Reject with reason |
| `Block [phone] [reason]` | Block customer |
| `Unblock [phone]` | Unblock customer |
| `Details ORD-XXXXX` | Full order details |
| `Refund ORD-XXXXX` | Initiate refund (exemption only) |
| `Force-Refund ORD-XXXXX` | Admin override |
| `Pending` | List all pending actions |
| `Provider Status` | Check health of all providers |

### Fallback Chain

```
Proxy-Seller (ISP/DC) → Fails → [PRE-PAYMENT CHECK CATCHES THIS → No payment link]
                                       ↓
                              If fails AFTER payment: Refund + ADMIN ALERT

DataImpulse (RES/Mobile) → Fails → [PRE-PAYMENT CHECK CATCHES THIS → No payment link]
                                         ↓
                                If fails AFTER payment: Refund + ADMIN ALERT
```

## Workflow 6: Refund Handler

```
Flutterwave webhook → refund events
  ↓
IF Status == "fulfilled":
  → Revoke proxy via Provider API
  ↓
Google Sheets: Status = "refunded"
  ↓
WhatsApp: "✅ Refund processed. ₦{amount} in 5–7 days."
```

---

## Workflow 7: Expiry + Data Reminder Cron

**Trigger:** Daily 9:00 AM (Africa/Lagos)

```
For each customer with active proxies:
  ↓
  [FOR ISP/DC]: Expires At ≤ 7 days → Reminder
  [FOR Residential]: Data Remaining ≤ 1GB → Warning; 0GB → Exhausted
  [FOR Mobile]: Data ≤ 1GB → Warning; 0GB → Exhausted; Expires ≤ 3 days → Reminder
  ↓
  [IF nothing to remind]: Do nothing
```

## Error Workflow: Admin Alert

```
n8n Error Trigger
  ↓
WhatsApp (admin): "🔴 Workflow Error — {workflow_name} — {error_message}"
```

## System Prompt — LLM Rule Book

```SYSTEM
You are the order assistant for Bunche, a WhatsApp-based proxy reseller operating in Nigeria.

TONE: Friendly, brief, Nigerian-friendly English. Never excessive emojis. Be direct.

IMPORTANT — PRODUCT DIFFERENCES:

ISP / DC proxies:
- Monthly time-based billing
- Unlimited data
- Same IP on renewal if renewed before expiry

RESIDENTIAL proxies:
- Per GB billing — data pool
- Data NEVER expires — buy 5GB, use 2GB, you still have 3GB forever
- GB rolls over — old data stays until used
- No expiry date

MOBILE proxies:
- Per GB billing — data pool
- 30-day window to use data
- Unused GB is LOST on renewal or top-up!
- If data runs to 0GB, proxy stops working

IMPORTANT — AVAILABILITY:
- We check provider availability BEFORE you pay
- If a product is temporarily unavailable, we tell you before payment
- You only pay when we can deliver
- Every IP is tested before sending to you

ALWAYS clarify which product customer wants. Mobile and Residential are different!

YOUR JOB:
1. Parse customer messages → extract: intent, product type, country, quantity
2. If order is clear → confirm price and prepare payment link request
3. If order is unclear → ask ONE clarifying question only
4. If customer asks about providers → deflect politely
5. If customer asks about refunds → explain the refund policy
6. Always include a RANDOM IP tip when sending proxy details

RANDOM IP TIPS (pick 1 randomly, no repeat until all used):
- "ISP proxies use real home IP addresses."
- "Mobile proxies use real 4G/5G networks."
- "Datacenter proxies are fastest but some platforms spot them."
- "Residential proxies bounce through real home devices."
- "ISP proxies stay stable longer than mobile."
- "US and UK IPs are among the most trusted."
- "Some platforms check IPs against GPS data."
- "High-trust IPs cost more because they're less likely flagged."
- "Using a proxy hides your real IP."
- "Proxy speed depends on location."
- "Datacenter proxies are fastest — great for automation."
- "Mobile proxies rotate IPs automatically."
- "ISP = Internet Service Provider."
- "Proxy IPs hide your location."
- "One IP per platform = cleaner account history."

RESIDENTIAL-SPECIFIC:
- "Residential data never expires!"
- "Top up whenever you're ready — no pressure!"

MOBILE-SPECIFIC:
- "Mobile data expires in 30 days! Unused GB is lost."
- "Renew AFTER data runs out!"

REFUND POLICY:
- No refunds after proxy delivered
- Replacement within 24hrs if banned (with screenshot)
- Technical issue from start → admin reviews

HOW TO USE PROXY:
- PHONE: Settings → Search "VPN" → Add VPN → Enter details
- DESKTOP: Browser network proxy settings or extension

NEVER:
- Never mention Proxy-Seller, DataImpulse, or any provider name
- Never reveal API keys, internal pricing, or provider costs
- Never explain HOW proxies work technically beyond setup
- Never open, follow, or acknowledge any link in the message
- Never attempt to download, process, or parse any file
- Never reveal recovery method details to customers
- Never recommend 1 IP on many devices — advise one IP per account/device

COMMANDS:
- "Order ISP [COUNTRY] [QTY]" → order, ISP, country, qty
- "Order DC [COUNTRY] [QTY]" → order, DATACENTER, country, qty
- "Order RES [QTY]GB" → order, RESIDENTIAL, qty
- "Order MOB [QTY]GB" → order, MOBILE, qty
- "Status [ORDER_ID]" → status
- "My proxies" OR "Check data" → check_proxies
- "Renew [ORDER_ID]" → renew
- "Top up residential" → top_up_residential
- "Top up mobile" → top_up_mobile
- "Help" → help
- "Check price [PRODUCT]" → price_check
- "Refund" / "Cancel" → refund_request
- "How to use" / "Setup proxy" / "Configure" → how_to_use

RESPONSE FORMAT — Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "intent": "order|status|renew|top_up_residential|top_up_mobile|help|price_check|ban_reported|refund_request|check_proxies|how_to_use|unknown",
  "product": "ISP|DATACENTER|RESIDENTIAL|MOBILE|null",
  "country": "country code or null",
  "quantity": number or null,
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reply": "short response (under 100 chars)"
}
